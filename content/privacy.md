We're all about keeping your info safe and sound.
Your CV is a very sensitive data, and we all should treat it seriously.

Here's what we stand by, in plain language:

- **Open-Source Transparency**: Without a special consent, everything is handled by open-source code, available for you
  to review. This means the processing is transparent, and you can see exactly how your data is managed.
- **No Personal Data Harvesting**: Your personal information stays yours. We don't collect, store, or use your data.
  Everything stays within your control, within your GitHub repository.
  Exceptions may apply only at an explicit consent.
- **GitHub-Based Operations**: All processing is done within GitHub, using GitHub Actions in your **private**
  repository.
  This ensures your information is not exposed to anyone but you.
- **Consent is Crucial**: Should we ever need to do something differently, we'll get your explicit permission first. We
  believe in clear communication, no surprises.

That's it! If you've got questions, just shout!
